    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        A North African dish that’s quite popular in the Middle East. 
        This is my version made of eggs in tomato in one pan on the stove, it’s not just a breakfast recipe but also a great lunch or dinner. 
        Cheap, healthy and easy to make! 
        Make sure you have plenty of bread to soak up those juices.

        <li>3 cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>1 whole red chili</li>

        <li>700ml - 24oz of crushed or tomato purée</li>
        <li>5 or 6 eggs</li>
        <li>4oz - 110g of goat's cheese</li>
        <li>1 hand full of flat leaf parsley</li>
        <li>Some rustic or Challah bread for toasting</li>
        <li>Salt and black pepper</li>
        <li>Some olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Step 1
            <p>
                Peel and dice the whole brown onion, the red and green capsicums (seeded and stem removed). Trim the chili and remove the seeds, chop finely. Chop the parsley (washed) and set aside.        </li>
        <li>Step 2
            <p>
                To a frying pan on medium heat, add 2 tbsp of olive oil and gently sweat the chopped onions and chopped chili. Add the paprika, ground cumin and cayenne pepper. Mix well and add the garlic cloves minced or finely sliced. Add the red and green capsicums (bell peppers) and season with salt. Add the tomato purée, turn heat to very low and simmer gently for 15 minutes.            </p>
        </li>
        <li>Step 3
            <p>
                Crack the eggs into cups or ramekins to avoid the egg yolk breaking and the possibility of any egg shell. Once the sauce is thick enough to make a well, create a well for each egg and then gently pour each egg in each well. Cover with lid and keep cooking on stove on very low heat until the whites are cooked. This takes approx 6 minutes.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>Step 4
            <p>
                Peel and dice the whole brown onion, the red and green capsicums (seeded and stem removed). Trim the chili and remove the seeds, chop finely. Chop the parsley (washed) and set aside.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>Step 5
            <p>
                Once the whites are cooked to your liking remove the lid, crumble some goat’s cheese and garnish with chopped parsley. Serve immediately.            </p>
