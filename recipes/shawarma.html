    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Shawarma is a popular middle eastern dish you will often see as street food. 
        It normally consists of lamb or chicken meat that’s been cut thinly and stacked on a vertical rotisserie for slow cooking.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 Chicken thighs</li>
        <li>4 x Pita bread</li>
        <li>½ cup plain natural yogurt</li>
        <li>1 tsp smoked paprika</li>
        <li>½ tsp cardamom</li>
        <li>1 tsp cumin powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp coriander</li>
        <li>1 tsp dried chili flakes</li>
        <li>½ tsp cinnamon</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>1 lemon juiced plus zest</li>
        <li>3 tbsp Olive Oil</li>
        <li>1 lemon juice and zest</li>
        <li>Salt and black pepper</li>
        <li>1 cup plain yoghurt</li>
        <li>2 tbsp tahini</li>
        <li>cucumber</li> 
        <li>Charred Capsicum slices</li>
    <li>lettuce leaves (Iceberg)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Step 1
            <p>
                Place the chicken thighs in the freezer until half frozen.  This will help to slice thinner.  You can skip this step; it simply helps to cut thinner pieces.  Once half frozen, remove from freezer and using a very sharp knife, slice each thigh very thinly.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>Step 2
            <p>
                Place all the chicken pieces in a mixing or marinating container. Add the yogurt, smoked paprika, cardamon, cumin powder, coriander, dried chili flakes, cinnamon, 3 garlic cloves, olive oil, salt and black pepper. Using a micro-plane, grate the zest of one lemon, then squeeze in the juice.  Mix well so each piece has been coated. Refrigerate for at least 2-12 hours.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>Step 3
            <p>
                Remove the chicken from the fridge 30 minutes before grilling.  Have a baking tray or sheet pan lined with foil ready.  Place an oven proof rack on top so the chicken juices drip away.  This avoids stewing the chicken. Lightly grease it with olive oil then place your chicken mixture on top.  Spread out the pieces evenly so ideally there’s space between each one.  Place under your grill or broiler element at full heat and on the closest adjustment. Grill the chicken for about 5 mins per side or until the chicken has signs of dark browning on the rough edges.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>Step 4
            <p>
                Meanwhile, make the sauce simply by combining the yoghurt with the tahini, and garlic. Season with salt and pepper, mix well.  Keep refrigerated when storing.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>Step 5
            <p>
                To assemble, heat up your pita bread, either wrap them in foil and heat up in an oven. Or do what I do, simply throw it on the flame a few times.  You don’t want to toast it, simply heat it up, the bread should be soft not crispy.  Lay out the bread on your bench, smother the garlic sauce all around, then add the torn lettuce leaves, the bell pepper, dill cucumber and the hot chicken pieces.  Wrap tightly in paper and serve to enjoy immediately.
